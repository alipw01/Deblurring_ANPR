# ANPR Deblurring Project

## Overview

This ongoing project focuses on Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) with a specific emphasis on deblurring techniques. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of ANPR systems by employing advanced image deblurring methods.

## Objective

The primary objective is to improve on the accuracy of existing ANPR systems upon the application onto motion-blurred images - a key limitation as reported by many existing papers.

## Features

- **Image Deblurring:** Application of various deblurring techniques to enhance the clarity of number plates.
- **ANPR Integration:** Integration with a tailored ANPR system to better handle instanced of motion-blurred images.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ANPR-Deblurring.git`
   - Navigate to the project directory: `cd ANPR-Deblurring`
   - Install dependencies using Poetry: `poetry install`

## Dependencies

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Other dependencies managed by Poetry (`pyproject.toml`)
